## Objectives

In this capstone, , then we try to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Description
In actuality there are a lot of companies inside the Space Race, making advances in the search for making space travel affordable for everyone. Virgin Galactic is providing suborbital spaceflights. Rocket Small is a small satellite provider for example. But there is a company that is the most successful at this moment, which is SpaceX. They advertise Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Our job is  to determine the price of each launch and also determine if Space X will reuse the first stage using all the skills learned from the different courses to perform data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, and model evaluation.â€‹
